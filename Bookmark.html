  <h2 id="C1">Diet Mountain Dew by Lana Del Rey</h2>
<p>[Intro]
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want you

<br>[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?


<br>[Verse 1]
Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says I been waitin' up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is Say it's gonna be alright

<br>[Pre-Chorus]
Hit me, my darling, tonight
I don't know why but I like it
Gotta get back to the wild
Give it up, give it up
Live it up, live it up

<br>[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

<br>[Verse 2]
Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

<br>[Pre-Chorus]
Hurt me and tell me you're mine
I don't know why but I like it
Scary? My God, you're divine
Gimme them, gimme them dope and diamonds

<br>[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
<br>[Bridge]
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby, I want you, I want you
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby, I want you, I want you, I want you

<br>[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

<br>[Post-Chorus]
Baby stoppin' at 7-Eleven
There in his white Pontiac Heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

<br>[Chorus]
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?</p>

<h2 id="C3">Running Up That Hill by Kate bush</h2>
<p>It doesn't hurt me
Do you wanna feel how it feels?
Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me?
Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making?
You, it's you and me

<br>And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, ooh

<br>You don't wanna hurt me
But see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts

<br>Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we?
You, it's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

<br>And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, ooh

<br>You
It's you and me
It's you and me won't be unhappy

<br>Oh, come on, baby. Oh, come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh, come on, angel. Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, ooh

<br>And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

<br>Say, if I only could
